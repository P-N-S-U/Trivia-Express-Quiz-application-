# Trivia-Express-Quiz-application-
A simple quiz application built using Java Swing & AWT, running entirely on the front end without any database integration. This was my first project, designed as a fun and interactive way to test knowledge through a lightweight UI.

🚀 Getting Started
Start the application by running "Main.java" located in the Main folder.

⚠️ Important Notes
The background image location may vary based on your system, which could lead to loading issues. If encountered, update the file path accordingly in the code.

<b>Adding New Questions</b>: If you want to add new questions, I have provided a template for easy modification. Just insert your question, update the options, and adjust the marking scheme to fit your needs.
